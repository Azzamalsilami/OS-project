# Description

In this semester, you will work in teams of 5 to implement a scheduler and memory manager for an operating system using Python. The project will involve building these specific components of an operating system.

# Phase 1

You will form teams and submit a proposal outlining your approach to building the scheduler and memory manager. The proposal should include:
* a high-level design, key features, and a timeline for implementation.
* Team members and leader

# Phase 2

You will implement a scheduler module in Python. You will explore different scheduling algorithms, such as round-robin, shortest job first, or priority-based scheduling. The scheduler should handle process creation, context switching, and scheduling decisions based on the selected algorithm.

You will implement a memory manager module in Python. You will explore different memory allocation algorithms, such as first-fit, best-fit, or buddy allocation. The memory manager should handle memory allocation and deallocation requests from processes/threads and manage memory efficiently

# Deliverables
Throughout the semester, teams will submit progress reports, design documents, and code implementations. The final deliverable will include an implementation of the scheduler and memory manager, along with a comprehensive report documenting the design decisions, implementation details, challenges faced, and the contributions of each member in the team. More importantly, you should show through an illustrative example that your implementation works.

# Guidelines
* Document your code thoroughly, including clear explanations of functions, classes, and modules.
* Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance code readability.
* Include comments to explain complex choices of implementation.
* Document any external libraries or dependencies used in your code.
* Consider including examples or sample inputs/outputs to illustrate how your code should be used.

# External resources
* You are encouraged to utilize external resources for debugging and error checking purposes.
* But ensure that you understand the concepts and requirements of the assignment before referring to external resources.
* Properly cite any external resources used in your documentation to maintain academic integrity.
* Rely primarily on your own knowledge and problem-solving skills to complete the assignments.
* Utilize ChatGPT or similar tools as a supplementary aid rather than relying on them solely for completing the tasks.

# Important Note
Failing to Adhere to the aforementioned guidelines will result in receiving zero points for this project, in addition to reporting any misconduct to the department.
